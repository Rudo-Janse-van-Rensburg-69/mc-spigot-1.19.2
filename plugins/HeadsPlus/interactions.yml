# This is the section where you can specify unique interactions with heads.
# These can be specified with location, name and texture.
# Locations are placed at the highest priority and are formatted as 0x0y0zworld_name. (Replace the 0s with the coordinates you want and world_name with the world's name.)
# Names, or names stored inside the skull, are placed at the following priority. It is as simple as specifying your own name, e.g. Thatsmusic99.
# Texture checks are placed at the lowest priority. These can be Base64 strings, Minecraft Textures/Education URLs or skin hashes.
